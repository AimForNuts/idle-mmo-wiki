# Dungeons

Dungeons in the game allow you to engage in combat for long periods without needing to interact directly, unlike battling enemies. They are also the main way to get recipes, which you need to craft the strongest items.

The game has various dungeons, each with different difficulty levels. As a dungeon's level increases, so does its difficulty, making it harder to succeed.

Participating in dungeons requires a significant investment of both time and currency to obtain the best items. As dungeon levels increase, the costs in both gold and time also go up.

#### Dungeon Difficulty

- Every dungeon has a **difficulty rating**. This number tells you how strong your character needs to be (in total combat stats) to enter and survive the dungeon.
- To enter a dungeon, your combat stats must be at least **70% of its difficulty**.  
  For example, if the dungeon **"Nexus"** has a difficulty of **1,500**, you'll need **at least 1,050 combat stats** to get in.
- After completing a dungeon, you’ll lose some health. The amount you lose depends on how your combat stats compare to the dungeon’s difficulty.

##### In simple terms, dungeon difficulty affects:
- **Entry** – You can’t enter if your stats are too low
- **Health loss** – The closer your stats are to the dungeon’s difficulty, the less health you’ll lose
- **Magic Find bonus** – If your stats are much higher than the dungeon’s difficulty, you’ll gain bonus magic find.

#### Magic Find Bonus

Magic Find is a stat that increases your chances of finding rare items in dungeons. If your combat stats are significantly higher than the dungeon's difficulty, you will receive a bonus to Magic Find.

The bonus you receive is scales depending on how much higher your combat stats are compared to the dungeon's difficulty. The better your equipment, the higher your magic find.


##### Combat Stats

The following stats are used to determine your combat stats: [Attack Power](/wiki/character/stats?same_window=true), [Protection](/wiki/character/stats?same_window=true),  [Agility](/wiki/character/stats?same_window=true), and [Accuracy](/wiki/character/stats?same_window=true).

##### Dungeon Difficulty Example 

>!banner The range is within **30%** of the difficulty. A 30% reduction of a dungeon with 100 difficulty brings it down to 70. A 30% increase raises it to 130.

| Your Combat Stats | Difficulty | Result             |
|-------------------|--------------------------------|  ---- |
| Combat stats < 70 | 100 | Cannot enter the dungeon       |
| Combat stats = 70 |  100 | You lose all health            |
| Combat stats = 100 |  100 | You lose 50% health            |
| Combat stats = 130 | 100 | You lose minimal health        |
| Combat stats > 130 | 100 | You gain a bonus to Magic Find |



#### Chaining Dungeons
Dungeons can be chained up until the maximum idle time that your character can handle. However, you can only chain dungeons that you are able to complete with relative ease according to your stats against the dungeons difficulty.

For instance, if your character can successfully complete a dungeon run at the cost of 60% HP, then you will be unable to chain that dungeon because doing the dungeon twice in a row would result in your character being defeated at 120% HP.

#### Dungeon Shop

- Every dungeon beyond level 70 gets dungeon shards.
- Dungeon shards can be exchanged in the vendor for: Dragon Soul Stones, Essence Crystals, and Potions.
- Dungeon shards are obtained every time you complete a dungeon.

### Success Chance

The success chance determines if you are able to receive loot at the end of the dungeon.

Your chance of successfully completing a dungeon depends on your combined `Protection`, `Attack Power`, `Agility`, and `Accuracy`. 
All of which can be increased by levelling up the corresponding stat (for example, levelling up `Strength` will increase your `Attack Power`) or by equipping items that boost these stats.

Even if you fail the dungeon, you will still be rewarded with the experience points. The success chance only affects loot.
