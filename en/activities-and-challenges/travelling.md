# Travelling

Embark on journeys across [Solaris Isle](/wiki/lore/solaris-isle?same_window=true), where each location is brimming with unique items critical for skill development, such as ores for mining and trees for logging. Moreover, new dungeons await to be discovered in these varied locales.

#### Traveling Made Easy

- Start your exploration by clicking the `Map` button. From there, navigate and select your next destination.

**Pro Tip:** Boost your [Movement Speed](/wiki/character/stats?same_window=true) stat to reduce travel times between locations, making your adventures more efficient and allowing you to gather resources faster.

#### Teleportation Costs

The cost of teleportation is based on your character's total level across all skills, except for those that are whitelisted.

The following skills are excluded from increased teleportation costs as they have minimal impact on the game's economy: `Springtide Mastery`, `Shadow Mastery`, `Lunar Mastery`, `Guild Mastery`, `Yule Mastery`, and `Pet Mastery`. This means you can level up these skills without affecting your teleportation costs.

#### Seasonal Campaign Locations

Some locations are only available when their seasonal campaign is live. You can only teleport or travel to these event locations while the campaign is active - if the campaign isn’t active, the game won't let you go there.

Once you're at an event location, the campaign must stay active. If you want to switch to another campaign, you’ll need to leave the event location first.

It might take up to __10 minutes__ for the event location to appear after the campaign starts, as the server takes time to update.

Teleporting to seasonal campaign locations is free - __no gold is required__.

At the end of the seasonal campaign, your character will be automatically teleported out of the event location, and you won’t be able to access it again until the next seasonal event rolls around.
