# Civilizations
[Valaron](/wiki/lore/the-world?same_window=true) is a world full of diversity, home to many races and civilizations that have risen over countless ages. Humans were the first to walk its lands, but as time passed, other civilizations appeared - orcish clans with their strong traditions, the Oakenra, wise tree-like beings, and many others. How these races first came to Valaron is a mystery, one even the most learned scholars cannot fully explain.

Legends tell of a time when the skies split open with a brilliant flash of light. Old writings say this event marked the arrival of these new civilizations. According to the story, with that single flash lighting up the night, these races suddenly appeared. However, the truth of these ancient texts is uncertain, clouded by contradictions.

One popular belief ties this event to the myth of the great serpent - a being so vast that [Valaron](/wiki/lore/the-world?same_window=true) is said to lie within its watchful eye. Some say the flash of light was simply the serpent blinking, and that this brief moment brought new life and worlds into existence, like reflections in its gaze.

### Eldoria
The Eldorians of [Solaris Isle](/wiki/lore/solaris-isle?same_window=true) have a bold dream to spread their rule across all of [Valaron](/wiki/lore/the-world?same_window=true). Their capital city, Eldoria, is more than just a home - it is the heart of their people and a symbol of their ambition to build a powerful empire. In Eldorian society, old ideas about class and gender do not matter. Everyone is treated equally and given the same chance to succeed. Progress is not just valued here; it is a way of life.

Yet, the Eldorians also carry the burden of a dark past. Long ago, one of their emperors tried to wipe out an entire people. Much of the truth about this time was lost in the Great Fire of Eldoria, which destroyed many important records. Some believe the fire was set on purpose to erase the shame of history. Even so, Eldoria rose from the ashes. Today, they have built a strong friendship with their neighbors in Arvandor. They trade goods and have promised to defend each other, proving that even a nation with a troubled history can work toward peace and cooperation.

### Arvendor

The Arvendor are a powerful civilization that lives in a grand place called The Citadel. They are believed to be direct descendants of the gods, and this divine heritage has earned the respect of the land dwellers. Their entire history and culture are deeply tied to the heavens, shaping how they see themselves and their role in the world.

But in today's age, where the gods are no longer seen and are remembered only in old stories, many people across [Valaron](/wiki/lore/the-world?same_window=true) have grown doubtful. Some question if the Arvendor are truly linked to the gods at all - some even question if the gods ever existed. Aware of these doubts, the Arvendor mostly keep to themselves, rarely involving themselves in the affairs of the outside world. They guard their secrets carefully behind the walls of The Citadel.

More than 50,000 years ago, the Arvendor played a key role in a legendary war against a dark enemy known as the Ombric. This great conflict ended with the Ombric being banished to the underworld. Today, that war is little more than a faded memory, even among the Arvendor themselves. Still, rumors speak of a man who survived from that ancient time - a living witness to the battle. Whether true or not, his story only deepens the mystery surrounding the Arvendor and their place in the world.

### Mokthar
The Mokthar are a civilization of orcs known for their strength and love of battle. For generations, they have taken pride in small raids and skirmishes, enjoying the thrill of combat without seeking the destruction that full-scale wars bring. But under their tough exterior, a struggle is growing.

Recently, a rebellion within their ranks has shown that many Mokthar are tired of constant fighting. They are looking for change - wanting a future built on progress instead of endless war. At the same time, the outside world often judges them unfairly, seeing only savage warriors and ignoring the real depth and variety within their people.

In search of a new life, some Mokthar have begun to move to Solaris Isle. They carry with them the spirit of their homeland - its hardships, its history - and the hope of starting fresh, far from the old ways they are trying to leave behind.

### Oakenra
The Oakenra are an ancient civilization of wise, tree-like beings who have acted as silent guardians of their realm for thousands of years. Their long lifespans give them a deep knowledge and understanding that few others can match.

For most of their history, the Oakenra have stayed neutral, avoiding the conflicts and politics of the outside world. But now, change is stirring among them. [Oilegeist](/wiki/lore/notable-characters?same_window=true), a newly appointed member of their respected elder council, believes that staying neutral for so long has caused the Oakenra to grow stagnant.

In secret, Oilegeist has begun making hidden agreements with [Astaroth](/wiki/lore/notable-characters?same_window=true), a powerful and dangerous wizard from the underworld. This break from centuries of tradition remains unknown to the rest of the council. If discovered, Oilegeistâ€™s bold and risky actions could change the future of the Oakenra forever.

### Ombric
Deep in the dark underworld live the Ombric, a civilization made up of many monstrous races, each representing pure evil. It is said that only the most corrupted souls - those far beyond redemption - end up among the Ombric. Their home is a hidden realm beneath the surface, a world of darkness completely unlike the lands above. In the underworld, evil is not just present - it grows and thrives.

The Ombric did not choose this exile. Long ago, their chaos and violence spread across the surface world, leading to a great war against the Arvendor, the self-proclaimed divine descendants of the gods. After a fierce battle, the Arvendor defeated the Ombric and sealed them away deep underground, where they have remained, forgotten by most.

Centuries have passed, and the details of that ancient war have faded, even in the minds of the Arvendor. But the Ombric have never forgotten. Their memory of defeat burns bright, feeding a deep hatred and a thirst for revenge.

Now, the ruler of the underworld is dying, and a struggle for power has begun. [Astaroth](/wiki/lore/notable-characters?same_window=true), a master of manipulation, sees his chance to rise. Most Ombric cannot leave the underworld because of the powerful enchantments left by the Arvendor, but a few of the strongest can break free for a short time.

Meanwhile, Astaroth works in secret, spreading chaos across the world above. Few realize the danger he poses. His influence has even reached the Oakenra, as he has made a secret pact with one of their powerful leaders. This hidden alliance could soon tear apart the world above, piece by piece.
