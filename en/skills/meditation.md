# Meditation

Meditation is a unique skill in idleMMO that is entirely based on the concept of selflessness and the helping of others, rather than yourself.


#### How It Works

Getting started is easy:

- Just press **Start** to begin meditating.
- You’ll gain EXP at a base rate of **0.8 EXP per second**.

#### Guidance Scrolls (Unlocked at Meditation Level 35)

At level 35, you unlock the ability to create **Guidance Scrolls** - powerful items designed to **boost other players**.

Here’s how they work:

- You’ll earn **0.1 EXP/s** while writing guidance scrolls.
- You need a **Blank Scroll** to write one. You can buy these from the vendor.
- You **can’t** use a guidance scroll on yourself or your alts - this skill is all about helping *others*.
- The higher your Meditation level, the **stronger the boost** in the scroll.
- Once given, the scroll’s effect is applied **instantly** and lasts for **2 hours**.
- Writing a scroll takes **60 minutes**.
- You can’t write more scrolls than your **maximum idle time** allows. For example:
    - If your idle time cap is 2 hours, you can’t queue up 5 scrolls (which would take 2.5 hours total).
- If you cancel a scroll mid-way:
    - Any **unused blank scrolls** are refunded.
    - Any scrolls already **in progress** are *not* refunded.

#### Enlightenment

Reach **level 100** and you’ll achieve **Enlightenment** — a prestigious milestone with a cosmetic twist.

- Your character will float slightly on its profile page giving it an ethereal aura.

#### Sound Effects

While meditating, you can listen to various sound effects to help you relax.

- __Rain__ - The sound of rain falling.
- __Snowfall__ - The sound of snow falling.
- __Fireplace__ - The sound of a crackling fireplace.
- __Thunderstorm__ - The sound of a thunderstorm.

>!banner Due to technical limitations with the web browser, the sound effects must be manually enabled.

#### Notes

- The Meditation skill is **purely focused on helping others** - it’s not designed to benefit your own character directly.
- Progression is intentionally slow - not only does it take months of dedication, but it also means you're sacrificing time that could’ve been spent on other skills.
- Reaching **Enlightenment** is meant to be a rare and meaningful achievement that reflects **patience, dedication, and selflessness**.
