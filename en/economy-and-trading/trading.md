# Trading

Trading is a way for characters to directly send items and gold between each other without using the market.

#### How to start a new trade

1. Navigate to the profile of the character you want to trade with.
2. Press "Trades" to open the trade window. This will list any previous trades you have had with the character.
3. Press on "New Trade" to start a new trade.
4. Add items and gold by pressing on the respective buttons.
5. Once you are satisfied with the trade offer, press "Accept". Once both parties have accepted the trade, the items and gold will be transferred.

#### Free

When trading with another character, there is a fee associated with every transaction. The fees are as follows:

- __13%__ on the total value of the trade offer (Free players)
- __10%__ on the total value of the trade offer (Membership players)
- A base fee of __10 gold__ to any party sending gold or items.

__Important note:__ The fee is only calculated on the items and gold that you add to the offer. You do not pay a fee on the items and gold you receive.

Any recipient that has not added gold or items to the trade offer will not pay a fee.

##### Example: Trade between a Non-Member and a Member

| Trader      | Status | Gold Added | Item Value | Total Value of Offer | Fee Rate | Fee Amount |
|-------------|--------|------------|------------|----------------------|----------|------------|
| Character A | Non-Member | 100 | 200 | 300                  | 13%      | 39 Gold    |
| Character B | Member | 0 | 1,500 | 1,500                | 10%      | 165 Gold   |

**Breakdown:**

- Character A (is not a member) adds __100 gold__ and items worth __200 gold__ to their trade offer. This means the total value of Character A's trade offer is __300 gold__.
- Character B (is a member) adds no gold but adds items worth 1,500 gold to their trade offer. This means the total value of Character B's trade offer is __1,500 gold__.
- Character A will pay a fee of __39 gold__ (13% of 300 gold) and Character B will pay a fee of __165 gold__ (10% of 1,500 gold).

**Note:** Members enjoy a lower fee rate (10%) compared to non-members (13%).


#### Notes

- The IdleMMO administration do not reimbuse scams or trades gone wrong. While the administration will punish any offenders, it is up to the players to ensure they are trading with trusted players.
- Pending trades that have not been updated are deleted after __5 days__.
- For the sake of convenience, items obtained via a trade may exceed the inventory limit. However, you will not be able to obtain any more items or perform any further actions until you have freed up space in your inventory.
- Incoming trades can be disabled in the character settings page.
- If a character has __10 pending trades__, they will be unable to start or receive any new trades until they have completed or cancelled some of their pending trades.
- The maximum number of unique items (not the quantity) that can be added to a trade is __10__.
- If the trade changes after a party has accepted, the accepting party will need to re-accept the trade. They will be notified of the changes.
- A red outline is shown on any items that cannot be fulfilled (for example, the item is no longer in the inventory).
- Trading between alternative characters on the same account is allowed.
- Alternative characters require a minimum total level of __150__ to trade.
- Completed trades after 3 months will no longer be accessible.
