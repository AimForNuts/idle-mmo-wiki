# Market

The Market is your go-to platform for trading items with other players through listings and market orders.

---

### Listings

Listings feature items put up for sale by players across the realm of IdleMMO. Prices here follow the laws of supply and demand, set by the free market.

>!banner Act fast if you spot a bargain! Listings can expire or be snapped up by other players at any moment.

### Orders

Purchase Orders are requests by players looking to buy specific items. If you own an item someone else wants, you can sell it directly at the order price listed.

>!!banner When you list an item for sale, the system checks for matching Purchase Orders. This means your item could be sold instantly if it meets an existing order's criteria.

>!banner As of version 0.42.0-PB, you will be unable to fulfill Purchase Orders directly. Instead, you can list your items for sale, and the system will automatically match them with existing Purchase Orders.
