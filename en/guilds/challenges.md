# Challenges

Challenges are efficient ways for the guild to quickly accumulate experience. Members with specific ranks within the guild have the authority to create challenges, each lasting for 24 hours.

These challenges promote collaboration within the guild, encouraging members to work together towards shared goals. Objectives may include tasks like acquiring a specific quantity of items and contributing them to the challenge.

Upon successful completion of a challenge, the guild earns experience points. Additionally, participants receive 2 experience points for every item they contribute towards the challenge, regardless of whether the challenge is fully completed.

As the guild levels up, more challenges can be completed within 24 hours.

#### Refreshing Challenges

If a challenge is too difficult, higher-ranking members can refresh a specific challenge for no additional cost. The guild is limited in how many challenges can be refreshed in a single day.

The number of challenges that can be refreshed is dependent on the guilds level.

The number of challenges that can be refreshed ranges from 1 to 4.

At guild level **1**, a guild can only refresh **1** challenge.
At guild level **100**, a guild can refresh **4** challenges.
