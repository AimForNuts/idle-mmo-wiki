# Raids

Guild members can participate in raids to earn experience and rewards. These collaborative events are organized by the guild leader. High-ranking members prearrange raids, allowing guild members to join a lobby before the raid starts. When the scheduled timer reaches zero, the raid begins automatically.

The guild's experience gain depends on the number of participants in the raid. More participants result in more experience points for the guild.

Individual participants earn experience by successfully completing guild raids, receiving both [Combat Experience](/wiki/character/skills) and [Guild Mastery Experience](/wiki/character/skills).

Raids are designed to scale in time, with higher-tier raids taking longer to complete but offering greater rewards. These rewards include more experience per participant and more experience gained per second. So, while higher-tier raids demand more time, they provide richer rewards for both the guild and its members.

Participants forfeit rewards if they leave a raid before it is complete, resulting in reduced rewards for the guild as well.
