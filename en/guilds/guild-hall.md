# Guild Hall

Guild Halls will serve as a central hub for guilds, providing access to key features – including Assaults, which we’ll cover later in this post.

Building a Guild Hall won’t be easy. Guilds will need to gather a significant amount of materials to construct one. While we can’t dive into the exact material requirements just yet, the goal is for Guild Halls to act as a large item sink, so expect the costs to be substantial. Logs and bars will play a big role in this, giving them much-needed utility in the game.

### Level Requirement

A guild needs to be at least **level 10** to construct a Guild Hall.

### Guild Components
Guild Halls have been designed to be as modular as possible. 

Guilds will be able to add components to their hall. These components essentially unlock different areas within the guild, ranging from minor quality-of-life upgrades to major new mechanics. Some will be small quality-of-life changes, while others will introduce entirely new ways to interact with your guild.

To add a component to the guild, the guild hall must have a free slot. If the guild hall does not have a free slot, you can either remove an existing component, or build a new slot which will cost resources.

#### Decay and Repairs
Guild components decay over time, meaning they’ll require upkeep. If a component’s condition reaches 0, it will become unavailable until it is repaired. However, don’t worry – decay happens at a relatively slow rate, so you won’t need to constantly spend resources just to keep things running.

Repairs can be done at any time, and the amount of resources required depends on the component’s current condition. However, keep in mind that while a component is being repaired, it won’t be accessible, and any benefits it provides will be temporarily disabled.

For example, if a guild has a Conquest Banner component – which allows them to perform Assaults – they won’t be able to launch assaults while the component is under repair. Repairs might take a few hours, so proper planning will be key.

## Energizing Pool

![Energizing Pool](https://cdn.idle-mmo.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=100,height=100/uploaded/skins/01JNZVRV7XN456RW010X8GSQG7.png)

The **Energizing Pool** is a guild component that provides a temporary, time-limited boost to all guild members. To activate it, the guild must spend Guild Marks – once activated, the pool remains active for 3 hours.

During this time, any guild member can enter the Energizing Pool and receive free boosts at no personal cost. These boosts remain active until the pool expires.

The strength of the boosts is directly tied to the [Guild Mastery](/wiki/character/skills?same_window=true) level – lower mastery levels will result in weaker boosts, while higher mastery levels will make the Energizing Pool a valuable tool.

**Boosts**: Range from **1**% to **15**% depending on the character's [Guild Mastery](/wiki/character/skills?same_window=true) level. 
**Guild Level Required:** 15  
**Mark Cost:** 20
#### Resources Needed:
- **75,000** Spruce Logs
- **75,000** Maple Logs
