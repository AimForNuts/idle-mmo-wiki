# Conquest

Guilds can enhance their influence by participating in conquests. Guilds can launch **assaults** on various locations within the game. During an assault, any defeated enemy within the targeted location contributes **experience points (EXP)** to the guild and its progress.

>!banner A **Conquest Banner** component is needed to perform conquests.

>!banner Members participating in a conquest will earn **Guild Mastery** EXP.

### Guild Experience
Guild experience is calculated as a percentage of the total EXP a player earns from defeating enemies. The stronger the enemy, the more experience the guild receives.

#### Example:
- If a guild launches an assault on **Bluebell Hollow**, and a member defeats **1,200 scaled goblins**, earning **150,000 EXP**, the following rewards are applied:
    - The guild receives **7,500 EXP** (5% of the player's EXP).
    - The conquest receives **7,500 EXP** (5% of the player's EXP).
    - The player gains **7,500 Guild Mastery EXP** (5% of the player's EXP).

>!banner Attacking **higher-level NPCs** or **scaling weaker enemies** results in more EXP.

>!banner The EXP your guild earns is also influenced by your character’s effects. So, if you’re using potions, buffs, or anything else that boosts your EXP gain, your guild will benefit too - both in regular guild EXP and conquest EXP.

>!banner EXP is calculated individually for each enemy and always rounded down. Because of this, there may be times when the Guild Mastery EXP or Conquest EXP ends up slightly less than the expected 5%.

#### Negative Effects
 The minimum amount of guild EXP you can earn from an enemy during an assault is now based directly on that enemy’s EXP value. This means guild EXP cannot drop below this base amount, even if you are affected by negative class effects, such as the Forsaken class’s -50% EXP penalty.<br/>
 
For example, if you defeat an enemy that gives 50 EXP, the Forsaken class will now earn a minimum of 2 guild EXP (5% of 50 is 2.5, rounded down to 2).

### Territory Control
Guild assaults are not just about experience – they also determine **territory control**. The guild with the most EXP in a location by the end of the season becomes its ruler for the following season, granting them exclusive boosts within that region*.

#### Example:
- If **Guild A** and **Guild B** are both competing for Bluebell Hollow, but **Guild A** secures more EXP, they will be crowned as the rules for the next season.
- Occupying guilds receive **region-specific boosts** for the duration of their rule.

_*As of v0.38.0-PB, the seasonal regional-specific boosts are still in development and will be introduced in a future update likely before the end of the season._

### Notes
- Guilds can assault multiple locations but can only launch one assault at a time.
- Assaults are performed in waves. Each wave takes **6 hours**. 
- Each assault costs **10 marks** to initiate.
- Poor planning, such as spreading forces too thin or wasting marks, could leave a guild unable to initiate future assaults.
- Only battles that start _after_ the assault is launched will count towards the guild's conquest.

>!banner Future updates may introduce **siege equipment** to enhance assaults. For example, Guilds might be able to construct trebuchets using materials from their stockpile.
