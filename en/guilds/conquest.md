# Conquest

Guilds can enhance their influence by applying a **Conquest Banner** to their guild hall. This unlocks the ability to launch **assaults** on various locations within the game. During an assault, any defeated enemy within the targeted location contributes **experience points (EXP)** to the guild. Additionally, members will earn **Guild Mastery EXP** for their participation.

### Earning Guild Experience
Guild experience is calculated as a percentage of the total EXP a player earns from defeating enemies. The stronger the enemy, the more experience the guild receives.

#### Example:
- If a guild launches an assault on **Bluebell Hollow**, and a member defeats **120 scaled goblins**, earning **15,000 EXP**, the following rewards are applied:
    - The **guild** receives **1,500 EXP** (10% of the player's EXP).
    - The **player** gains **1,500 Guild Mastery EXP**.

This system encourages players to take on **higher-level NPCs** or **scale weaker enemies** upward for increased rewards.

### Territory Control & Seasonal Rewards
Guild assaults are not just about experience â€“ they also determine **territory control**. The guild with the most **kills** in a location by the end of the season becomes its **ruler** for the following season, granting them **exclusive boosts** within that region.

#### Example:
- If **Guild A** and **Guild B** are both competing for **Bluebell Hollow**, but **Guild A** secures more kills, they will be crowned as the **occupiers** for the next season.
- Occupying guilds receive **region-specific boosts** for the duration of their rule.

### Strategic Considerations
- Guilds can **assault multiple locations** but can **only launch one assault at a time**.
- Each assault **costs marks** to initiate.
- Poor planning, such as **spreading forces too thin** or **wasting marks**, could leave a guild unable to initiate future assaults.

### Future Enhancements
Future updates may introduce **siege equipment** to enhance assaults. For example:
- **Trebuchets**: Guilds might construct trebuchets using materials from their stockpile, providing perks such as:
    - Increased **EXP percentage per kill**.
