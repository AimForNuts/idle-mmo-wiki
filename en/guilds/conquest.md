# Conquest

Guilds can enhance their influence by participating in conquests. Guilds can launch **assaults** on various locations within the game. During an assault, any defeated enemy within the targeted location contributes **experience points (EXP)** to the guild and its progress.

>!banner A **Conquest Banner** component is needed to perform conquests.

>!banner Members participating in a conquest will earn **Guild Mastery** EXP.

### Earning Guild Experience
Guild experience is calculated as a percentage of the total EXP a player earns from defeating enemies. The stronger the enemy, the more experience the guild receives.

#### Example:
- If a guild launches an assault on **Bluebell Hollow**, and a member defeats **1,200 scaled goblins**, earning **150,000 EXP**, the following rewards are applied:
    - The guild receives **7,500 EXP** (5% of the player's EXP).
    - The conquest receives **7,500 EXP** (5% of the player's EXP).
    - The player gains **7,500 Guild Mastery EXP** (5% of the player's EXP).

>!banner Attacking **higher-level NPCs** or **scaling weaker enemies** results in more EXP.

### Territory Control & Seasonal Rewards
Guild assaults are not just about experience â€“ they also determine **territory control**. The guild with the most EXP in a location by the end of the season becomes its **ruler** for the following season, granting them exclusive boosts within that region*.

#### Example:
- If **Guild A** and **Guild B** are both competing for **Bluebell Hollow**, but **Guild A** secures more kills, they will be crowned as the occupiers for the next season.
- Occupying guilds receive **region-specific boosts** for the duration of their rule.

>!banner *As of v0.38.0-PB, the seasonal regional-specific boosts are still in development and will be introduced in a future update likely before the end of the season.

### Notes
- Guilds can assault multiple locations but can only launch one assault at a time.
- Assaults are performed in waves. Each wave takes **6 hours**. 
- Each assault costs **10 marks** to initiate.
- Poor planning, such as spreading forces too thin or wasting marks, could leave a guild unable to initiate future assaults.


>!banner Future updates may introduce **siege equipment** to enhance assaults. For example, Guilds might be able to construct trebuchets using materials from their stockpile.
