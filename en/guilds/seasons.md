# Seasons

Guilds in IdleMMO can compete in seasons to earn a prestigious, permanent status for the respective season.

Each season spans __60 days__, and a guild's placement is determined solely by the experience they gather during that time.

At the end of each season, guilds will earn rewards based on their final ranking.
