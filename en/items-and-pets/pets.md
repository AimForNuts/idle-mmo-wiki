# Pets

Pets in IdleMMO are not just companions; they're a significant aspect of the gameplay, offering various advantages. With a diverse selection of pets, each excels in different roles, influenced by their inherent traits.

#### Choosing and Equipping Pets

- Larger pets tend to boast a higher [Movement Speed](/wiki/character/stats) stat.
- Agility may vary, with some pets naturally outperforming others.

Equipping a pet boosts your own stats correspondingly. For instance, a pet's [Movement Speed](/wiki/character/stats) of 20 m/s will be added to your character's speed. Note that only one pet can be equipped at a time.

#### Pet Status

- Keep your pet content and fed to maintain its stat bonuses. Neglect could lead to reduced efficiency.
- Feed your pet to alleviate hunger and interact with it to boost happiness.

**Remember:** Pets' happiness and hunger levels deplete with time, so regular care is crucial.

#### Pet Battles

You can engage your pets in battles against enemies, allowing them to gain experience and enhance their stats over time.

The duration of a pet's battle is influenced by its health and stats. A pet will only return to your character after its health is depleted. Additionally, the length of the time your pet is away is negatively affected if the pet is sent while hungry, unhappy, or with diminished health.

The experience gained from battles varies based on the location where the pet is fighting. Locations with stronger enemies provide a higher rate of experience per second for the pet.

When a pet returns from battle, it automatically goes back to the location where it was fighting. If you are not present at that location when the pet returns, you will not be able to interact with it until you travel to that specific location.

The table below indicates the minimum pet level required to battle in each location:

| Pet Level Required | Location                     |
|-----------|------------------------------|
| Lv. 1         | Bluebell Forest              |
| Lv. 8         | Whispering Woods             |
| Lv. 18        | Eldoria                      |
| Lv. 32        | Crystal Caverns              |
| Lv. 48        | Skyreach Peak                |
| Lv. 60        | Enchanted Oasis              |
| Lv. 70        | Floating Gardens of Aetheria |
| Lv. 78        | Celestial Observatory        |
| Lv. 92        | Isle of Whispers             |

**Pro Tip:** Battling in higher-level areas yields more experience per second, making it more efficient. However, these fights are shorter, requiring more frequent interaction from you to maintain effectiveness. You'll need to decide if this trade-off is worthwhile!

##### Maximum Concurrent Battles

The number of pets you can send on a battle depends entirely on your `Pet Mastery` level. The higher your `Pet Mastery` level, the more pets you can send on battles.

It scales from **2** pets, to **10** pets. This means, if you reach the maximum `Pet Mastery` level (lv. **100**), then you can send **10** pets to battle at the same time.


#### The Incubation Period

- Newly acquired pets from eggs undergo an incubation period.
- High-quality pets typically require a longer incubation before hatching and becoming available.

Each pet brings unique benefits to your adventure, so choose wisely and take good care of your companion!
