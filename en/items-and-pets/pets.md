# Pets

In IdleMMO, pets aren’t just loyal companions - they’re a key part of the game, offering unique advantages. With a wide variety of pets to choose from, each one shines in specific roles thanks to their differing stats.

#### Stats

- Larger pets tend to boast a higher [Movement Speed](/wiki/character/stats?new_page=true) stat.
- Equipping a pet boosts your own stats correspondingly. For instance, a pet's [Movement Speed](/wiki/character/stats?new_page=true) of 20 m/s will be added to your character's speed. Note that only one pet can be equipped at a time.
- Agility may vary, with some pets naturally outperforming others.
- Increasing your [Pet Mastery](/wiki/character/skills?new_page=true) skill also increases the stats of your pets. It scales from **0%** bonus to a **20%** bonus. This means, at level 100 [Pet Mastery](/wiki/character/skills?new_page=true), your pets will have a **20%** bonus to their stats.

#### Status

- Keep your pet content and fed to maintain its stat bonuses. If you neglect it, it will become unhappy and hungry, leading to a decrease in its stat bonuses.
- Feed your pet to alleviate hunger.
- Pat your pet by simply clicking on it to boost its happiness.

**Remember:** Pets' happiness and hunger levels deplete with time, so regular care is crucial.


#### Equipping Pets

When you equip a pet, all its stats are added to your character’s. For example, if your character has 20 attack power and your pet has 15, your total effective attack power becomes 35. This is also the primary way to boost your character’s movement speed stat.

Equipped pets also gain experience from your battles, allowing you to level up both your character and your pets simultaneously.

#### Patting and Happiness

You can keep your pet happy by giving it a pat! The happiness boost your pet gets from each pat depends on your [Pet Mastery](/wiki/character/skills?new_page=true) level—the higher your mastery, the more happiness your pet gains with just a simple tap.

The happiness your pet gains from a pat ranges from **15** to **150** points, depending on your [Pet Mastery](/wiki/character/skills?new_page=true) level. At level **100** mastery, each pat grants **150** happiness points - often enough to completely fill your pet’s happiness bar with just one pat.

#### Battles

You can engage your pets in battles against enemies, allowing them to gain experience and enhance their stats over time.

The duration of a pet's battle is influenced by its health and stats. A pet will only return to your character after its health has reached 0.

The experience gained from battles varies based on the location where the pet is fighting. Locations with stronger enemies provide a higher rate of experience per second for the pet.

When a pet returns from battle, it automatically goes back to the location where it was fighting. If you are not present at that location when the pet returns, you will not be able to interact with it until you travel to that specific location.

You might also notice that your pet battles last much longer than your character’s. This is because pets aren’t as strong as your character, so it takes them more time to defeat enemies.

The table below indicates the minimum pet level required to battle in each location:

| Pet Level Required | Location                     |
|-----------|------------------------------|
| **Lv. 1**         | Bluebell Forest              |
| **Lv. 8**         | Whispering Woods             |
| **Lv. 18**        | Eldoria                      |
| **Lv. 32**        | Crystal Caverns              |
| **Lv. 48**        | Skyreach Peak                |
| **Lv. 60**        | Enchanted Oasis              |
| **Lv. 70**        | Floating Gardens of Aetheria |
| **Lv. 78**        | Celestial Observatory        |
| **Lv. 92**        | Isle of Whispers             |

**Pro Tip:** Battling in higher-level areas yields more experience per second, making it more efficient. However, these fights are shorter, requiring more frequent interaction from you to maintain effectiveness. You'll need to decide if this trade-off is worthwhile!

##### Pet Status and Health

A pet’s status and health play a vital role in how long battles last. If your pet is unhealthy, weak, hungry, or unhappy, its performance will suffer, leading to less-than-ideal results.

##### Loot

Your pet can return back loot after it has finished it's battles. The chance of loot is dependent on a variety of factors - including the pets stats (which influence how long the pet can battle for and how many enemies it can battle), as well as your [Pet Mastery](/wiki/character/skills?new_page=true) level. 

The [Pet Mastery](/wiki/character/skills?new_page=true) level directly influences the chance of obtaining a loot per enemy. It currently scales from 2.5% to 10% chance of obtaining loot per enemy. This means, at level 100 [Pet Mastery](/wiki/character/skills?new_page=true), you have a **10%** chance of obtaining loot per enemy.

##### Length of Battles

The duration of battles depends on your pet’s stats and health. Keeping your pet healthy and happy is crucial - it ensures peak performance during battles. If your pet’s health isn’t at its max, it won’t perform as well, and you risk missing out on valuable experience.

Battle length is also affected by the location. Higher-level locations might lead to shorter battles as your pet won't be able to keep up at the same rate, which means you’ll need to check in on your pet more often to keep it fighting at its best. You’ll need to weigh the trade-offs: is it worth the extra effort of a more “hands-on” experience in higher-level areas for faster EXP gains, or would you prefer longer battles in lower-level areas for a more relaxed approach?

**Pro tip:** Your [Pet Mastery](/wiki/character/skills?new_page=true) level indirectly influences the length of battles because it increases your pets stats. The higher your [Pet Mastery](/wiki/character/skills?new_page=true) level, the stronger your pet will be.

##### Maximum Concurrent Battles

The number of pets you can send on a battle depends entirely on your [Pet Mastery](/wiki/character/skills?new_page=true) level. The higher your [Pet Mastery](/wiki/character/skills?new_page=true) level, the more pets you can send on battles.

It scales from **2** pets, to **10** pets. This means, if you reach the maximum [Pet Mastery](/wiki/character/skills?new_page=true) level (lv. **100**), then you can send **10** pets to battle at the same time.


#### The Incubation Period

- Newly acquired pets from eggs undergo an incubation period.
- High-quality pets typically require a longer incubation before hatching and becoming available.
- Pets acquired from a campaign are immediately available for use.
