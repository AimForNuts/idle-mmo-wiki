# Qualities

In IdleMMO, the quality of an item or any in-game entity is a key indicator of its power and rarity at a given level.

#### Understanding Quality and Rarity
- Higher quality typically means greater rarity, but rarity also depends on the item type and its abundance in the game world. However, this is a general rule of thumb and is not always the same case.
- Item quality does not inherently determine rarity across different types of items. For example, even though a `refined` item generally indicates less rarity than an `epic` item, a `refined` [Pet Egg](/wiki/items-and-pets/item-types) could be less common than an `epic` [Sword](/wiki/items-and-pets/item-types).
Qualities and rarities across different item types do not correlate. For instance, a refined [Pet Egg](/wiki/items-and-pets/item-types) might be rarer than a epic .
- The actual rarity is determined by the item's circulation, details of which are available on the item inspection page.

>!banner There is a special "Unique" quality tier that applies to items in the game that are extremely unique and are not obtainable through normal gameplay.  These items are typically given out as rewards for special events or achievements.
