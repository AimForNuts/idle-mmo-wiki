# Equipment

In IdleMMO, the right equipment is crucial for enhancing your character's abilities. It's the sole method to boost your character's [stats](/wiki/character/stats), pivotal for mastering various skills.

#### Equipment Varieties

The game offers a wide variety of gear. Whether you're equipping specialized [Pickaxes](/wiki/items-and-pets/item-types) for mining or wielding a powerful [Sword](/wiki/items-and-pets/item-types) for battle, you have many options to customize your character. Each piece of equipment provides different stat bonuses, with some pieces significantly outperforming others in terms of power.

#### Assessing Equipment

To understand how powerful your gear is, look at two main things: [quality](/wiki/items-and-pets/qualities) and level. Generally, higher [quality](/wiki/items-and-pets/qualities) means the gear is stronger, helping your character handle tougher challenges more easily.

#### Upgrading Equipment

- Equipment can be upgraded by applying the relevant [Upgrade Stone](/wiki/items-and-pets/item-types) to it. 
- It takes longer to upgrade an item the higher the existing item tier is.
- The [quality](/wiki/items-and-pets/qualities) of the equipment and its [type](/wiki/items-and-pets/item-types) determines how many [Upgrade Stones](/wiki/items-and-pets/item-types) are required.
- Mythic gear requires one Dragon Soulstone ![Dragon Soulstone](https://cdn.idle-mmo.com/cdn-cgi/image/height=15,width=15/uploaded/skins/01HXVFKQKPC4N8XM0RN3X9CSPH.png) in addition to upgrade stones for each upgrading level.

#### Obtaining Equipment

In IdleMMO, getting equipment works a bit differently than in many other games. Instead of finding gear directly from enemy loot or chests, players need to craft items using recipes. These recipes are earned by completing dungeon runs.

Alternatively, players can skip the process of earning recipes by buying them from the market. However, even with purchased [Recipes](/wiki/items-and-pets/item-types), you'll still need materials to craft the item. Players also have the option to directly purchase the desired item from the market.

#### Upgrade Limits

For Standard, Refined, Premium and Epic equipment the maximum number of times you can upgrade an item is fixed.
For Legendary and Mythic equipment the upgrade limit is tied to the item itself rather than its quality. This means that a stronger legendary helmet might allow for more upgrades than a weaker legendary helmet, even if they share the same quality tier.
