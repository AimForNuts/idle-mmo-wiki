# Guilds

Guilds provide a platform for players to come together and participate in cooperative events. They enable various activities, such as coordinated raids and challenges.

However, the guild feature is continuously evolving. Future updates will introduce additional mechanics like guild halls and [World Boss](/wiki/activities-and-challenges/world-bosses) spawning, enriching the gameplay experience even further.

-----

### Levelling and Experience

Boosting the guild level through experience provides added benefits, such as expanding member capacity. Further enhancements are planned for future releases. As the guild level increases, you'll unlock additional raids and be able to participate in more daily challenges.

-----

### Marks

Marks are the currency earned through guild challenges. They allow access to various guild mechanics, such as refreshing challenges and participating in raids.

Currently, the sole method to acquire tokens is by completing challenges.

As a general rule of thumb, each challenge completed earns __1 point__. Refreshing a challenge costs __4 points__. The cost to start a raid varies based on its difficulty level.

-----

### Member Limit

The guild member limit is dependent on the guilds total level.

| Member Limit | Guild Level |
| ----- | ----- |
| __20__ Members   | Lv. __1__ |
| __21__ Members | Lv. __35__ |
| __22__ Members | Lv. __60__ |
| __23__ Members | Lv. __70__ |
| __24__ Members | Lv. __85__ |
| __25__ Members | Lv. __100__ |

### Raids

Guild members can participate in raids to earn experience and rewards. These collaborative events are organized by the guild leader. High-ranking members prearrange raids, allowing guild members to join a lobby before the raid starts. When the scheduled timer reaches zero, the raid begins automatically.

The guild's experience gain depends on the number of participants in the raid. More participants result in more experience points for the guild.

Individual participants earn experience by successfully completing guild raids, receiving both [Combat Experience](/wiki/character/skills) and [Guild Mastery Experience](/wiki/character/skills).

Raids are designed to scale in time, with higher-tier raids taking longer to complete but offering greater rewards. These rewards include more experience per participant and more experience gained per second. So, while higher-tier raids demand more time, they provide richer rewards for both the guild and its members.

Participants forfeit rewards if they leave a raid before it is complete, resulting in reduced rewards for the guild as well.

------

### Challenges

Challenges are efficient ways for the guild to quickly accumulate experience. Members with specific ranks within the guild have the authority to create challenges, each lasting for 24 hours.

These challenges promote collaboration within the guild, encouraging members to work together towards shared goals. Objectives may include tasks like acquiring a specific quantity of items and contributing them to the challenge.

Upon successful completion of a challenge, the guild earns experience points. Additionally, participants receive 2 experience points for every item they contribute towards the challenge, regardless of whether the challenge is fully completed.

As the guild levels up, more challenges can be completed within 24 hours. If a challenge is too difficult, higher-ranking members can refresh a specific task for 2 marks.

#### Maximum Challenges

| Guild Level | Max Challenges |
| ----- | -------------  |
| Lv. __1__     |  __5__ Challenges             |
| Lv. __25__    |  __6__ Challenges             |
| Lv. __40__    |  __7__ Challenges             |
| Lv. __60__    |  __8__ Challenges             |
| Lv. __85__    |  __9__ Challenges             |
| Lv. __100__   | __10__ Challenges             |

#### Seasons

Guilds in IdleMMO can compete in seasons to earn a prestigious, permanent status for the respective season.

Each season spans __60 days__, and a guild's placement is determined solely by the experience they gather during that time.

At the end of each season, guilds will earn rewards based on their final ranking.

| Position               | Marks |
| ------------------------ | ------- |
| Position __#1__  | __100__ Marks |
| Position __#2__ | __80__ Marks |
| Position __#3__ | __60__ Marks |
| Position __#4__ | __45__ Marks |
| Position __#5__ | __35__ Marks |
| Position __#6__ | __30__ Marks |
| Position __#7__ | __25__ Marks |
| Position __#8__ | __20__ Marks |
| Position __#9__ | __15__ Marks |
| Position __#10__ | __10__ Marks |
| Position __#11 to #25__ | __5__ Marks |


Only guilds that place in the top 25 will receive rewards; those ranking below 10th won’t receive any.

- The game also tracks various season-specific metrics for each guild, such as the number of raids completed and challenges undertaken during the season.
- Guild rewards may take up to __6 hours__ to be distributed after the season concludes.

### Additional Notes

- A character can only join a guild once every 24 hours.
