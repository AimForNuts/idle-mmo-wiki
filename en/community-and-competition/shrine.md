# Shrine

The Shrine is a community-driven feature where players work together to unlock powerful boosts by contributing resources to reach specific tiers.

### How It Works

Players can contribute either **Gold** or **Tokens** to the Shrine. As the community contributes and reaches higher tiers, increasingly powerful boosts become available for activation. Each tier requires more contributions but offers better rewards.

### How To Activate Boosts

To activate boosts:
1. Visit any location with a Shrine.
2. Press on the "Nearby" button which can be located either in the "Menu" page (on the mobile apps) or at the top of the page (on the Web App)
2. Manually select and activate the tiers you want.

Once activated, the boosts will appear on your character page under the **Effects** section.

 If you activate boosts close to reset time, they will only last until the reset. For instance: As the Shrine resets at **12:00 PM UTC** and you activate boosts at **11:55 AM UTC**, you will only benefit for __5__ minutes.


### Token Contribution

Other than Gold, you can also contribute Tokens to the Shrine, and they will automatically be converted into Gold at a ratio of **800 Gold per Token**.  

For example:
- Contributing **10** Tokens equals **8,000 Gold** contributed to the Shrine.

>!banner Only characters at a total level of **600** and above may contribute tokens to the shrine.

### Reset Time

The Shrine resets **daily at 12:00 PM UTC**.

### Important Notes
- You can activate multiple tiers at once, and their effects will stack.  
  For example:
  - Tier 1 provides a **+15% EXP boost**.
  - Tier 2 provides a **+20% EXP boost**.
  - Activating both results in a total **+35% EXP boost**.
- Once a tier is unlocked, its boosts can be activated at any time during the day until the reset.
