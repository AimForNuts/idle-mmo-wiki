## Hunting and Battling

Engaging in battle in IdleMMO starts with finding enemies. This simple process sets the stage for your combat encounters.

- To start, navigate to the **Battle** Page and click **Start Hunt**. This initiates the hunting phase.
- Upon completion, a selection of enemies will appear on the page. Simply press on an enemy and then **Battle** to initiate the fight. Choose your opponent wisely, taking care not to engage with enemies out of your league, as enemies significantly stronger than your character may be impossible to defeat.
