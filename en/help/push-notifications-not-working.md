# Push Notification Troubleshooting

In some some instances, the push notifications may fail to work even when using the "Resync" functionality. This is more common on the Web App due to the poor tools provided by OneSignal.

There are various troubleshooting steps you can take to resolve this issue:

## Mobile App (Android)

#### Clear your apps cache and data
1. Open your device's `Settings` app.
2. Tap `Apps & notifications`.
3. Find `IdleMMO`
4. Tap `Storage & cache`.
5. Tap `Clear storage` and `Clear cache`.
