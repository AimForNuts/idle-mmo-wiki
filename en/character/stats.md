# Stats

Stats are attributes that directly impact your character's performance in [battles](/wiki/activities-and-challenges/hunting-and-battling). Generally, the higher your character's stats, the better they will perform in actions that rely on those stats.


There are various stats in IdleMMO. Each one affects a different area or mechanic of the game.

| Stat | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| __Strength__ | Every level in `Strength` increases the characters `Attack Power` by __2.4__ which, in turn, determines how much damage is applied to the opponent. |
| __Defence__ | Every level in `Defence` increases the characters `Protection` by __2.4__ which, in turn, determines how much damage is absorbed from every hit. |
| __Speed__ | Every level in `Speed` increases the characters `Agility` by __2.4__ which, in turn, determines how fast battles are. |
| __Dexterity__ | Every level in `Dexterity` increases the characters `Accuracy` by __2.4__ which, in turn, determines if a character can successively hit the opponent without the opponent hitting back. |
| __Critical Chance__ | The chance that a character will land a critical strike. For example, if the chance is __15%__, then the character has a __15%__ chance of landing a critical strike on every hit. |
| __Critical Damage__ |  The bonus that is applied when landing a critical strike. This value is added on top of the characters attack power when a critical strike has been landed. |
| __Movement Speed__ | This determines how fast the character can [travel](/wiki/activities-and-challenges/travelling) and how fast they [hunt](/wiki/activities-and-challenges/hunting-and-battling). You can increase your movement speed by levelling up pets and equipping them. |
| __Attack Power__ | This determines how much damage is applied to the opponent. |
| __Protection__ | This determines how much damage is absorbed from every hit. |
| __Agility__ | `Agility` determines how fast battles are when [battling enemies](/wiki/activities-and-challenges/hunting-and-battling). |
| __Accuracy__ | `Accuracy` determines if the character can successively hit the opponent without the opponent hitting back. |
| __Damage__ | The fixed amount of damage applied at the end of every attack. This is added to the calculated damage from stats. <br/><br/>For example, if the battle formula __54__ damage against the opponent using the characters `Attack Power`, and the character has a __additional__ `damage` stat of __15__, the final damage would be __69__ (54 + 15). |
